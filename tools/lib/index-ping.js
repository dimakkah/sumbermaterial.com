/**
 * tools/lib/index-ping.js
 *
 * Correct, currently-working replacement for the old pingSearchEngines() in
 * recycle-posts.js. Checked against each service directly (August 2026) before writing this.
 *
 * WHY THE OLD PING LOGIC NEVER ACTUALLY DID ANYTHING:
 *   - ping.googleapis.com/ping?sitemap=   → Google retired the sitemap ping endpoint in June
 *     2023 (announced on the Search Central blog). It has returned 404 since late 2023.
 *   - www.bing.com/ping?sitemap=          → Bing retired its sitemap ping endpoint the same
 *     way; it returns 410 Gone.
 *   - rpc.pingomatic.com                  → Expects an XML-RPC POST body (the
 *     weblogUpdates.ping method), not a bare GET with the sitemap URL appended to the path.
 *     The old code (`axios.get(service + sitemapUrl)`) never sent a request pingomatic could
 *     parse, so this always silently no-op'd, independent of whether pingomatic itself still
 *     matters today.
 *   - www.sitemaps.org/ping?sitemap=      → sitemaps.org is the sitemap *protocol
 *     specification* site, not a search engine. It has never indexed anything submitted here.
 *   - www.feedburner.com/fb/a/pingSubmit  → FeedBurner's ping/submission API was shut down by
 *     Google years ago.
 *   - indexnow.org/ping?sitemap=          → Not a real IndexNow endpoint. IndexNow has no
 *     "ping a sitemap URL" call at all — see the real protocol implemented below.
 *
 * WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS TODAY:
 *   - IndexNow (Bing, Yandex, Seznam, Naver — Google does NOT participate; Google tested it
 *     in 2022 and chose not to adopt it): a POST with a JSON body listing the EXACT URLs that
 *     changed, plus a key proving domain ownership via a small text file hosted at the site
 *     root. Implemented below via the shared api.indexnow.org endpoint, which redistributes
 *     a single submission to every participating engine.
 *   - Google: there is no supported "push this URL now" call for ordinary content anymore.
 *     Google's Indexing API is officially restricted to JobPosting/BroadcastEvent pages only
 *     — using it for blog/product pages is outside its documented scope and not reliable.
 *     The correct, still-supported signal for Google is an accurate sitemap.xml with a
 *     correct <lastmod> (Google has confirmed it uses lastmod for crawl scheduling when it's
 *     consistently accurate) — which this project already does correctly via setLastmod() in
 *     recycle-posts.js and revise-articles.js. There is no additional "ping" call that
 *     replaces that for Google; nothing to add here beyond keeping lastmod accurate.

/**
 * Returns this site's persistent IndexNow key, generating it (and writing the required
 * static/<key>.txt verification file) the first time this ever runs. The SAME key must keep
 * being used on every future run — search engines validate submissions against the key file,
 * so a key that changes breaks verification.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — first-run-only caveat: when static/<key>.txt is created for the very first
 * time, it won't be LIVE on the real domain until the current CI job's build actually gets
 * deployed (a few steps later in the workflow). So the very first IndexNow submission ever
 * made may get rejected with a key-verification error (404 on the key file) purely because
 * deployment hasn't happened yet — this is expected and self-resolves from the next run
 * onward, once the key file is permanently live. Not a bug, just the order of operations.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this newly-created file must actually be committed to git (recycle.yml's
 * "Commit Changes" step was updated to `git add static/` for exactly this reason) or the key
 * file will never make it to the deployed site and every submission will keep failing.
